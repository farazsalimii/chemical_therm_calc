# Thermodynamic Calculator Web Application

This project is a simple **Thermodynamic Calculator** web application built using Flask. It allows users to calculate important thermodynamic quantities such as **Enthalpy**, **Entropy**, and **Gibbs Free Energy** through a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- **Enthalpy Calculation**: Input values for internal energy, pressure, and volume to calculate enthalpy.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Calculate entropy change based on reversible heat exchange and temperature.
- **Gibbs Free Energy Calculation**: Compute Gibbs free energy based on changes in enthalpy, entropy, and temperature.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (for the backend)
- HTML & CSS (for the frontend)
